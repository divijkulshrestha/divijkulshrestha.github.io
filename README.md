### Air Pollution Forecasting using Machine Learning
[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9590113)

Using publicly available datasets, I created a **Machine Learning** model to better predict PM 2.5 air pollutant levels using meteorological data (temperature, wind speed, relative humidity) for various Indian cities including New Delhi. We compared the performance of different models to see which worked best for this task, sharing our results in a conference paper. We deployed the most accurate models for six cities on Streamlit Community Cloud - check out  [BreatheEasy](https://breathe-easy.streamlit.app).
